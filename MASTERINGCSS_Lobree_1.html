  <h1>San Francisco</h1>
  <img src="./images/san_fran.jpg" alt="">
  <p>San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when 
    colonists from Spain established Presidio of 
    San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San 
    Francisco de As√≠s a few miles away, all named for 
    St. Francis of Assisi.[2] The California Gold Rush of 
    1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city 
    on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a 
    consolidated city-county in 1856.[27] San Francisco's 
    status as the West Coast's largest city peaked between 
    1870 and 1900, when around 25% of California's 
    population resided in the city proper.[28] After three-quarters of 
    the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire,[29] San 
    Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International 
    Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port 
    of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater.[30] 
    It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945.[31][32][33] 
    After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, significant immigration, 
    liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the "hippie" counterculture, 
    the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United 
    States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of 
    Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of 
    liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly 
    along liberal Democratic Party lines. </p>

  <p class="last-paragraph">A popular tourist destination,[34] San Francisco is known for its 
    cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, 
    and landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, the 
    former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, Fisherman's Wharf, and its 
    Chinatown district. San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major 
    banking institutions and various other companies such as Levi Strauss & 
    Co., Gap Inc., Fitbit, Salesforce.com, Dropbox, Reddit, Square, Inc., 
    Dolby, Airbnb, Weebly, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yelp, Pinterest, 
    Twitter, Uber, Lyft, Mozilla, Wikimedia Foundation, Craigslist, and 
    Weather Underground. The city, and the surrounding Bay Area, is a global 
    center of the sciences and arts[35][36] and is home to a number of educational 
    and cultural institutions, such as the University of San Francisco (USF), 
    University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco State University 
    (SFSU), the De Young Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the SFJAZZ 
    Center, and the California Academy of Sciences. </p>
